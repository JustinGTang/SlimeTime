# SlimeTime
My fun bot for Discord with Music and Maplestory command capabilites!

# What can I do?
I am able to keep track of members' Spotify listening history and give statistics such as each person's top 5 artists and top 10 songs. I am also able to play youtube audio, given a link. Aside from music, I remind members of Maplestory tasks, as well as store useful links for the game. Aside from these main functions, I have a few miscellaneous fun things I can do.
